# Jupyter React Clone - Notebook Selection Fix

## Issue
The Jupyter React Clone application had an issue where users could select a notebook initially, but couldn't switch to different notebooks afterward. The notebook content wouldn't update when selecting a different notebook.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `Notebook.js` component where the notebook selection logic wasn't working correctly after the first selection. The component was:

1. Only tracking the notebook name instead of the entire notebook object
2. Not properly detecting changes when switching between notebooks
3. Not resetting the active cell state when changing notebooks

## Solution
The following changes were made to fix the issue:

1. Changed from tracking just the notebook name to tracking the entire notebook object:
```javascript
// Before:
const previousNotebookName = useRef(notebook?.name);
// After:
const previousNotebookRef = useRef(notebook);
```

2. Updated the comparison logic to check the entire notebook object:
```javascript
// Before:
if (previousNotebookName.current !== notebook.name) {
  setCells(notebook.cells);
  previousNotebookName.current = notebook.name;
}
// After:
if (notebook && notebook.cells && notebook !== previousNotebookRef.current) {
  setCells(notebook.cells);
  previousNotebookRef.current = notebook;
}
```

3. Added a new effect to reset the active cell when switching notebooks:
```javascript
// Reset active cell when switching notebooks
useEffect(() => {
  setActiveCell(null);
}, [notebook]);
```

## Testing
A test script was created to verify the notebook selection functionality. The test confirmed that:
- Selecting notebook1 works correctly
- Switching to notebook2 updates the content properly
- Switching back to notebook1 again works as expected

The test script simulates the component behavior and verifies that the notebook content is updated correctly when switching between notebooks.

## Conclusion
The fix ensures that:
- The component properly detects when a different notebook is selected
- The cells are updated correctly when switching notebooks
- The active cell state is reset when changing notebooks

Users can now select different notebooks without any issues, and the UI will properly update to show the content of whichever notebook is selected.
