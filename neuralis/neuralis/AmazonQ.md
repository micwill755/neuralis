# Amazon Q Implementation Notes

## Docker-based Kernel Implementation

As requested, I've implemented Docker-based kernel support for the Neuralis Jupyter notebook clone according to the requirements in KERNEL_SETUP.md. This implementation allows users to:

1. Create Python kernels with different versions (3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10)
2. Select a kernel for each notebook
3. Execute code cells using the selected kernel
4. View execution results directly in the notebook

### Implementation Details

#### Backend (Server)

1. Created a `dockerService.js` module that provides:
   - Docker availability checking
   - Container building and management
   - Container listing, stopping, and restarting
   - Container logs retrieval
   - Build script generation

2. Updated `server/index.js` to expose API endpoints for:
   - Docker availability checking
   - Container management (build, list, stop, restart)
   - Container logs retrieval
   - Build script generation

3. Created a build script at `scripts/build_kernel_container.sh` that can be used to manually build kernel containers

#### Frontend (Client)

1. Modified `kernelService.js` to:
   - Remove simulated code for seaborn and matplotlib
   - Add real Docker-based kernel execution
   - Fall back to backend API execution if WebSocket connection fails
   - Properly handle kernel output including text, images, and errors

### How It Works

1. When a user selects "Build New Kernel" in the UI:
   - The frontend calls the backend API to build a Docker container
   - The backend creates a Dockerfile with the specified Python version
   - The container is built and started with the Jupyter Kernel Gateway
   - The container information is returned to the frontend

2. When a user connects to a kernel:
   - The frontend establishes a WebSocket connection to the kernel
   - The kernel is ready to execute code

3. When a user executes code:
   - The code is sent to the kernel via WebSocket
   - The kernel executes the code and returns the results
   - The frontend displays the results in the notebook

### Error Handling

- If Docker is not available, the user is notified
- If a container build fails, an error message is displayed
- If code execution fails, an error message is displayed in the notebook cell

### Future Improvements

- Add support for custom Python packages
- Implement kernel interruption
- Add kernel status monitoring
- Improve error handling and recovery
- Add support for other languages (R, Julia, etc.)
