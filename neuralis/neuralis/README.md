## Amazon Q CLI Integration

The application now integrates with Amazon Q CLI for AI assistance. This allows users to:

1. Ask questions and get responses from Amazon Q directly in the application
2. Insert code snippets generated by Amazon Q into notebooks
3. Get help with coding tasks, debugging, and more

### Requirements

- Amazon Q CLI must be installed on your system
- Run `q --version` to verify installation
- The application connects to the local Amazon Q CLI instance

### Usage

1. Click the "Show Amazon Q" button to open the assistant panel
2. Type your question or request in the input field
3. Press "Send" or use Ctrl+Enter to submit
4. Amazon Q will respond with text and/or code snippets
5. Click "Insert Code to Notebook" to add code to your current notebook
